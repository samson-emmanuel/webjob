      <button class="accordion">Wait…what do you all do again?</button>
      <div class="panel accordion-msg">
        <p class="accordion-msg">We offer several services, but Alden Energy Consulting LLC primarily helps manage and
          negotiate power and gas contracts for our customers. </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">How do we know that we’re getting a good deal?</button>
      <div class="panel accordion-msg">
        <p class="accordion-msg" style="line-height: 2;">This is the best question a customer can ask, especially when
          one considers the opacity of energy markets. We start looking at wholesale power pricing before anything and
          then evaluate your historical usage patterns across your meters. Pricing in general is based on a meter’s
          annualized load factor, which isn’t easily determined from a single bill copy. We can assign a range of
          “favorable pricing” retail adders based on the load factor/wholesale numbers/credit/etc. to easily determine
          which energy suppliers are serious about winning your business and which should be passed upon in this
          instance. </p>

        <p class="accordion-msg">Additionally, we have recently incorporated a third-party pricing estimation tool that
          provides a neutral viewpoint based on the same factors we’re always used to evaluate incoming bids. </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">How is Alden Energy Consulting LLC compensated?</button>
      <div class="panel accordion-msg">
        <p class="accordion-msg">In general, we are compensated by splitting the sales commission with the inside sales
          group of whatever Retail Energy Provider (REP) you might choose and ONLY IF you decide to go with them.
          Therefore, it’s imperative to our survival that we give our best effort with every customer to ensure you are
          seeing the most competitive pricing available that day. In certain cases, we may arrange a fixed-fee style
          agreement or receive referral fees on various projects from other third parties we work with.</p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">Why would I consider using a broker or consultant for this? We have a capable
        procurement team.</button>
      <div class="panel accordion-msg">
        <p class="accordion-msg">How close did they get to the wholesale price for your last power supply contract?
          Electricity procurement in deregulated markets is unlike purchasing anything else an organization needs. The
          product cannot be stored, and pricing fluctuates based on a dizzying confluence of factors. The complexity of
          the ERCOT market alone is beyond the scope of expertise for many participants, let alone a procurement manager
          who looks at electricity supply agreements every couple of years. We aim to ensure that all our customers are
          paying exactly what they should be based on their load factor, not simply “the best choice” on a poorly
          designed RFP/RFQ</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Can I expect any service after an agreement is executed through Alden Energy Consulting
        LLC?</button>
      <div class="panel accordion-msg">
        <p class="accordion-msg">Of course, we encourage customers to contact us first if anything ever comes up, so
          that they can concentrate on their own business. Not everyone behaves like this, but you can have our
          assurance that we will never disappear after any agreement is executed, rather we are happy to provide as much
          (or little) support as needed throughout its duration. We are constantly watching the market for future
          opportunities to hedge and can alert you to those, so you can concentrate on other matters. </p>

        <p class="accordion-msg">And while we never anticipate billing errors with any of the REPs we work with,
          occasionally situations arise that require additional expertise and we can almost always resolve anything far
          quicker than you might on your own. Simply never having to call the customer service department of a Retail
          Energy Provider is worth its weight in gold for our customers.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Can you just send us some bids? We’re currently looking at energy pricing right
        now.</button>
      <div class="panel accordion-msg">
        <p class="accordion-msg">How are you comparing bids that arrive? There are multiple variations of fixed pricing
          (much less anything more complex) and comparing bids from everyone that complied with such a request will make
          you quickly rethink the approach. If it were simply that easy, we wouldn’t exist in the market and would
          ultimately be doing you a disservice without, at a minimum, evaluating your historical usage prior to sending
          any executable pricing. We can however, provide ranges and pricing estimates based on what you tell us, but
          none of that can be used for decision-making purposes. Let’s discuss some options today.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Our company is looking to reduce energy expenditures across the board. Is that something
        you can assist with?</button>
      <div class="panel accordion-msg">
        <p class="accordion-msg">Of course, we can offer as much or little support as necessary. While we primarily
          specialize in electricity and natural gas procurement, we can also assist commercial customers with demand
          side management, utility bill auditing and other energy efficiency projects. That could include lighting
          retrofits, power factor correction, or equipment upgrade(s) if necessary. Over the years, we’ve encountered
          only a handful of customers who have exhausted all their options to optimize their energy management. </p>
